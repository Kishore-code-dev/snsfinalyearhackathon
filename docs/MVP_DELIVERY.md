# 🏥 VERTIXA: MVP Delivery Package (Hackathon)

## **Project Overview**
VERTIXA is a next-generation Institutional Invoice Authentication System designed to eliminate fraud and automate financial governance using Agentic AI.

## **Core Deliverables**

### 1. **Institutional Command Center (Frontend)**
- **Architecture**: Next.js 16 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS.
- **Design System**: "Institutional Blue" theme with a high-density Bento HUD.
- **UX**: Physics-based animations using Framer Motion for a "Cinematic AI" feel.
- **Key Views**:
    - `Command Center`: Executive overview of liquidity and risk.
    - `Neural Processor`: Real-time invoice extraction engine.
    - `Forensic Hub`: YOLOv8-powered visual document auditing.

### 2. **Neural Intelligence Layer (Backend)**
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Asynchronous Python).
- **Agent Orchestration**: Specialized agents for:
    - **Extractor Agent**: High-accuracy NER and OCR.
    - **Security Agent**: Forensic metadata analysis and multi-source verification.
    - **Decision Agent**: Autonomous threshold-based approval logic.
- **Forensic Vision**: Integrated YOLOv8 model for real-time object detection on physical invoices.

### 3. **Digital Forensic Engine**
- Multi-format support: PDF, JPG, PNG, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, TXT.
- Metadata scanning for document manipulation detection.
- Immutable Audit Logs: Every AI decision is recorded with a confidence score and rationale.
