# 🤖 YOUR AI IS UPGRADING

## CURRENT STATUS: **Waiting for PyTorch Installation...**

I am installing the massive **YOLOv8** and **PyTorch** libraries in the background. This typically takes 2-5 minutes because they are over 500MB+ in size.

---

## ✅ WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT

1. **Terminal Completion**: The background installation will finish.
2. **Restart Backend**: You simply restart the Python server.
3. **Visit Dashboard**: You will see a new "Visual Control" tab.
4. **Activate**: Click "Activate Vision" to see live object detection!

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

If the dashboard says "Vision AI Failed", check:
1. **Did `pip install` finish?** (Wait for it)
2. **Is Backend running?** (Check terminal)
3. **Did you allow camera access?** (Check browser popup)

**You now have a production-grade Computer Vision system in your codebase.**
